## Analysis Steps

1. *Obtain Sample Email*
   - Collected a publicly available phishing email for educational purposes.

2. *Examine Sender's Email Address*

3. *Check Email Headers*
   - Analyzed full email headers using tools like (https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)
   - Looked for discrepancies in Return-Path, Received, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

4. *Identify Suspicious Links or Attachments*
   - Hovered over links to detect mismatched or shortened URLs.
   - Checked attachments for dangerous file types like .exe, .js, or .docm.

5. *Look for Urgent or Threatening Language*
   - Detected common tactics like "Your account will be suspended!" or "Click immediately!"

6. *Note Mismatched URLs*
   - Ensured the displayed link text matches the actual URL.
   - Example: Text says paypal.com but link goes to secure-paypal-login.com.

7. *Verify Spelling or Grammar Errors*

8. *Summarize Findings*
   - Identified key phishing traits:
     - Spoofed email address
